# Berlin_public_transport_network
Collection of the individual pdfs used to create gif of the history of the Berlin public transport network

As part of the Grand Tour de Ã–ffentliche Verkehrsmittel, I created a gif of the U- and S-Bahn map showing how this has grown and changed from its inception to mid-2020. The blog post is found [here](https://pi-cycles.de/2020/11/25/4550/).

This repository stores the individual maps that make up the full gif.

Information about the U- and S-Bahn networks were obtained from https://www.berliner-linienchronik.de/ .
